[5 October 2025]

[OK] update the method > def save_my_results()

-----------------------------------------------------

[8 October 2025]

[OK] learn GMSH and create mesh --> specimen files for numerical examples for 	brittle fracture PFM implementation
        already two practice specimen files are saved 

[OK] still needs to saparate the Pre_processing data into specimen_files

[OK] create py_file that reads data from saved results and plots accordingly

[OK] update get_gpt_coords at the beginning of code where mesh is read

-----------------------------------------------------

[14 October 2025]

[Nok] update ppt file

[Nok] develop/update code for Phase-field (damage only) stiifness and residual update

[Nok] update the solver code for staggered PFM implementation

[Nok] create a python function that checks the convergence of the solution based on
        different user defined criteria
        - Maximum nodal norm error
        - Residual error
        - damage only error

[Nok] try to run codes for some brittle fracture numerical problems
        - displacement control
        - load control
        - langrange multiplier displacement controlled loading (optional)
